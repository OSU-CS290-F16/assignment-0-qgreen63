        <ul>
            <li><h3>Name</h3></li>
            Quanah Green

            <li><h3>Major/Year of Study</h3></li>
            Computer Science, and it's complicated. I finished most of my Junior year at Portland State, before transferring to OSU. This is my first term at OSU, and I think the school has me classified as a Junior. I should be able to get into Pro School after this term so I guess that is accurate...?

            <li><h3>HTML experience</h3></li>
            Maybe a 2-3. I've never spent any time with HTML, but I know the basics.

            <li><h3>What I want to learn</h3></li>
            How everything interacts in a webpage. I know that HTML and CSS and JS and PHP and any number of other technologies often contribute to a webpage, but I don't really know how all of those things fit together and what role each thing plays.

            <li><h3>Piazza?</h3></li>
            Yes, and my email inbox is paying for it.

            <li><h3>Interesting Fact</h3></li>
            Umm... Most interesting thing...

            I guess that I lived on a boat in Guatemala for a couple of years. When Iw as 16 my parents bought a 40' x 25' plywood catamaran in Florida. After we spent 6 months there fixing it up, we sailed to Guatemala, and proceeded to spend even more time fixing it (it never ends). Eventually I got sick of sanding epoxy and moced out to go come to college.
