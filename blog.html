        <h3>The Basics</h3> <i>9/25/2016</i>
        <p>This assignment was really fairly straightforward. In fact, getting the assignment in the first place was probably the most difficult part. GitHub didn't want to cooperate with me, and kept giving me an error saying I was forbidden from performing the action I needed to get the assignment. With the error message in hand, I turned to google, and discovered that it was an error associated with email verification. Though my email was indeed verified on github, I decided to try adding and verifying my OSU email to my account. This succesfully dispelled the troublesome error.</p>
        <p>Besides that minor challenge, the assignment was a good little refresher on basic html, but didn't pose much of a challenge</p>
